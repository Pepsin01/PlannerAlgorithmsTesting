# Planner Algorithms Testing

## Overview

This project is a collection of different algorithm implementations for solving a planning of appliance consumtion. The algorithms included are:

1. By Hand Algorithm
2. Greedy Algorithm
3. Linear Programming Algorithm
4. Naive Algorithm

Each algorithm is implemented in its own C# file, and they are integrated into a main program for execution and comparison. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate various approaches to solving the problem and to analyze their performance and efficiency.

## Files in the Project

1. **ByHandAlgorithm.cs**: Contains the implementation of the By Hand algorithm.
2. **GreedyAlgorithm.cs**: Contains the implementation of the Greedy algorithm.
3. **LinearProgrammingAlgorithm.cs**: Contains the implementation of the Linear Programming algorithm.
4. **NaiveAlgorithm.cs**: Contains the implementation of the Naive algorithm.
5. **Program.cs**: The main entry point of the application that integrates and executes the different algorithms.
